Title: Weather Prediction Using Multiple Machine Learning Classifier Models

In this study, the researchers have implemented three (3) machine learning classifier algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to predict the weather type using precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind levels.

The researchers have used Python 3.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0 version and Google Colab in coding and executing the machine learning model.
